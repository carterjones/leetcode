# overview

These are answers to LeetCode problems. These are for my reference, and in no
way represent the best solutions.

Some answers may be nearly identical to the solutions provided. I'm going
through these exercises to refresh my programming skills, not to come up with
the world's most unique and novel approach. If that means that I chose to copy
and modify the provided answers, then that's fine by me.
